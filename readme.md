Introducing a high-performance trading algorithm built with Python. This algorithm constantly checks each bar for specific conditions, and places an order if those conditions are met. The algorithm uses the Python Scheduler to loop every 'x' minutes, ensuring that the system is constantly monitoring the market and executing trades at optimal times. With this algorithm, you can automate your trading strategy, minimize manual intervention, and maximize your profits.
